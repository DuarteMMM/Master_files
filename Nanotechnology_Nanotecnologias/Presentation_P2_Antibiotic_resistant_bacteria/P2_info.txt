Date P2 (20 min slots)
DISCUSSIONS IN ROOM V1.07

Thursday, November 10: 16h30-18h30

*****************************************************************************

The class will organize itself in groups of 3

P2 slides (due on November 8 by email to joao.conde@tecnico.ulisboa.pt) is a 5-slide presentation of the group proposed solution 

P2 will be discussed with each group (20 minutes) in November 9-10 [the calendar and a link for registration will be available soon]

P2 challenge: use the concepts that you learned in the Nanotechnology/Nanobiotechnology course to develop an original proposal for one of the following topics: 

TOPIC 1 - an integrated system to check if people who are going to be admitted to a hospital are colonized by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This system should be able to have an answer in about 15 min and be inexpensive (with a potential cost at or below 10 Euros). Note that the system should be sensitive to 10-100 antibiotic-resistant bacteria per swab. 

TOPIC 2 - an integrated system that functions as an artificial nose with applications in biosafety and medicine. The system should be able to identify a panel of specific molecules of interest for environmental control or disease detection. Here it is importante to consider a reasonable-sized panel of compounds to detect (>10) 

Your proposal should consider (i) the general state of the art; (ii) the state of the art using micro and nanotechnological approaches; (iii) your proposed original solution; and (iv)  its technical details. Your slides should include a summary of this information. 

BE CREATIVE, WORK IN A TEAM, AND START EARLY!
